Problem Sheet Assignment Week02 : BMI.py
Task Requirement :

	1. Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI).

	The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
	The output  is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.
	$ python bmi.py
	Enter weight: 65
	Enter height: 180
	BMI is 20.06.

Notes, Assumptions & Error Checks

1. For both Height & Weight the program does a simple error check to verify that the input evaluates to a float, just to avoid obvious errors like someone entering a non digit

2. Given the height is expected in cm.

	I have attempted to do some error checking around the number entered to avoid an 			unrealistic answer

	I chose 272 as an upper limit for converting to metres bc the tallest ever recorded height is 	2.72metres

	I chose 24 as the lower limit for converting from cm to metres bc guinness book of records 	lists 24cm as shortest ever recorded

	If the input was between .24 and 2.72 I assume the value entered is already in m, tell the 		user and calculate accordingly

	If the input is greater than the tallest person in metres (2.72) or cm (272) or smaller than the 	smallest person in cm (24)
	or entered a negative number just to see then I print a message indicating I think there is a 		problem with the height entered

3. I make no assumptions about weight

The program then calculates their BMI using the formula kg/hsquared and outputs the result rounded to 2 decimal places

What I learned :

	1. How to prompt for user input
	2. How to assign variables
	3. How to construct a while loop
	4. How to test a condition using try & except
	5. How to do simple calculations using operators
	6. How to cast a variable to another type
	7. How to output a calculation

	1. W3Schools

Problem Sheet Assignment Week03 : bitcoin.py
Task Requirement :
	1. Write a program (bitcoin.py) that outputs the current bitcoin price in US
	Dollars. Use the supplied code snippet to get a Dict object that contains
        the price.
	2. Extra output all the price in the three currencies, in a neat way
	
Notes : 
	The url supplying the json data as well as the code to read & assign that data to a python object was supplied by the lecturer, Andrew Beatty
	The command cat - | jq . jsonstring was used to display the json data in an eye readable format 
	
What I learned :

	 1. Json Definition (wikipedia) :is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, 
	 that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value.
	 2. How to read a json url & assign it to a python object
	 3. How to parse the python object to access the data I wanted
	 
Resources :
	1. Google - to find a json formatting command (jq)
	2. Wikipedia - what exactly is 'json'
	3. W3Schools - Understanding Dicts
	4. StackOverflow - More about Dicts

Problem Sheet Assignment Week04 : collatz.py
Task Requirement :
	Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

	At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, 
	if it is even, divide it by two, 
	but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

	Have the program end if the current value is one.

What I learned :
	1. How to handle while loops, if statements and for loops
	2. How to print the contents of aa list without [], all on one line with spaces between each entry

Resources :
	1. Wednesday Lunchtime tutorial - print (list, end = " ") introduced by lecturer Andrew Beatty
	2. w3schools for conditional statements & try/except statements
	3. Example program on lecturers github showing how to manage multiple exceptions in a try/except statement. Didn't use this yet though.
